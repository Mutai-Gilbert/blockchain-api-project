# Blockchain API Project

## Overview

This project is a web application built with Express/Node.js that integrates with the Blockchain API. The goal is to retrieve blockchain data and present it in a user-friendly manner. Users can explore cryptocurrency-related information through this application.

## Objectives

- Develop an understanding of integrating public APIs into web projects.
- Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.
- Demonstrate the ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.

## API Choice

The chosen API for this project is the Blockchain API. This API provides [mention the type of data, e.g., cryptocurrency prices, transaction details, etc.]. Ensure that the API does not require authentication and is CORS-enabled.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-api-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd blockchain-api-project

```

3. Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

### Usage

1. Start the server:

```
npm start

```

2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

### API Integration

The project uses Axios to interact with the Blockchain API. The API endpoint is [https://api.blockchain.com/]. Ensure a stable internet connection for proper data retrieval.
## Data Presentation

The retrieved blockchain data is presented in the `index.ejs` file. The default presentation displays the raw JSON data. You can customize the HTML and CSS in the `views/index.ejs` file to improve the presentation based on your preferences.

## Error Handling

Error handling is implemented for both the application and API requests. If an error occurs, relevant messages will be displayed to the user. Additionally, error details will be logged in the server console for debugging purposes.

## Documentation

Comments are included throughout the code to explain the logic and improve code readability. The `Readme.md` file serves as comprehensive documentation for the project.
